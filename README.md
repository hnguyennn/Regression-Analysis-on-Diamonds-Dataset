# PSTAT 126 - Regression Analysis Final Project, Spring 2025

## Overview
This project was completed as part of the PSTAT 122 course at University of California, Santa Barbara, taught by Professor Puja Pandey. 

## Objectives
- Describe and analyze the variables in the dataset.
- Create and interpret both simple and multiple linear regression models.
- Construct and interpret both prediction and confidence intervals.

## Dataset
The dataset used, Diamonds Prices, was a public dataset from Kaggle. The download details are listed below.

## Methods
The project was split into three parts:

### Part 1: Data Description and Descriptive Statistics
- Describe characteristics of variables.
- Visualize using plots.
- Check for correlation between variables using correlation matrix.

### Part 2: Simple Linear Regression
- Interpret coefficients and output of a simple linear regression model.
- Construct and interpret confidence and prediction intervals.
- Perform various methods on the model to ensure linearity.

### Part 3: Regression Model using Backwards Elimination
- Create a multiple linear regression model using backwards elimination with AIC.
- Check for multicollinearity using variance inflation factor (VIF).
- Construct and interpret confidence and prediction intervals.

## Results
Through this project, I gained experience in analyzing a dataset and exploring relationships between variables. 
I learned how to detect and address multicollinearity, construct and interpret both simple and multiple linear regression models using two different approaches, 
and generate confidence and prediction intervals to evaluate model performance.
